## &#x1F385; &#x1F936; 'Tis the season to be jolly!

Bring yuletide cheer and seasons greetings to your [favorite R IDE](https://rstudio.com). Based on the [Yule tmTheme](https://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/#!/editor/theme/Yule) and modified to fit in well with RStudio Dark Mode. It's surprisingly pleasant and merrily festive!

## Installation

You'll need RStudio version 1.2. Grab the [preview version here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/).

1. Run the following code in RStudio to download and apply the theme.

   ```r
   yule_theme <- fs::path_temp("Yule-RStudio", ext = "rstheme")
   download.file("https://git.io/yule-rstudio", yule_theme)
   rstudioapi::addTheme(yule_theme, apply = TRUE)
   ```

1. &#x2615; Make a cup of hot coco,

    &#x1F4FB; turn on [SomaFM's Christmas Lounge](https://somafm.com/christmas/), 
    
    &#x1F4BB; and enjoy coding by the open fire.

#### Manual Installation

If the steps above don't work, you can manually download the [Yule-RStudio.rstheme](Yule-RStudio.rstheme) file and place it in `.R/rstudio/themes` in your R home directory (see `path.expand("~")`). Then, in the RStudio appearance settings, select the _Yule RStudio_ editor theme. 

### Disclaimer: This theme may waste some CPU cycles in the spirit of the holidays!

This theme adds an animation to the regular and vim normal mode cursors that may increase your CPU usage.
To disable animations, edit the theme file in `~/.R/rstudio/themes/Yule-RStudio.rstheme`

```r
rstudioapi::navigateToFile(
  fs::path_home_r(".R", "rstudio", "themes", "Yule-RStudio.rstheme")
)
```

Find the CSS blocks for `.ace_cursor` and `.normal-mode .ace_cursor` and comment out the lines starting with `animation-*`.

```css
.ace_cursor {
  color: #ff0010;
  /*
  animation-name: xmas-colors;
  animation-duration: 30s;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  animation-timing-function: steps;
  */
}
```
